# typescript-template
Basic typescript project

# Requirements
- Node and npm, which are bundled in one installer that can be found on http://nodejs.org/

# Usage

- Run `npm install` To install dependencies
- Run `npm install -g webpack` To install webpack
- After the dependencies and webpack are installed, use `webpack` to build the project.
  You can use `webpack --watch` to keep the command active on the background.
  The program will detect changes in the filesystem and rebuild the project when that happens.

Enjoy!
